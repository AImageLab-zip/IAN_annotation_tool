# IAN Annotation Tool

## Python environment
The best way to get the things start is to use an Anaconda environment.
In order to get all the packages installed, it's better to create a conda virtual environment, because otherwise opencv will not install (actually I don't know why).
Without the Anaconda environment I struggled and failed to install mayavi with pip.
